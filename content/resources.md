# My Favorite Resources!

This is a comprehensive list of things I think are awesome and they may help you!

## [News.Jace.Pro](news.jace.pro)

[Jace Benson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacebenson/) has built an AWESOME ServiceNow news aggregation service. If it's being talked about in the ServiceNow ecosystem, Jace has probably covered it! He also has a weekly newscast if reading it isn't your thing!



## [SNUtils](https://www.arnoudkooi.com/)

If you haven't checked out SNUtils by the fantastic Arnoud Kooi, you're probably adding hours to your daily tasks! Honestly, it makes development in the platform SO MUCH EASIER! It's easy to use and it's feature packed! I especially like the column names printed on forms! Don't forget to give him [a follow on Twitter](https://twitter.com/sn_utils) while you're at it!
